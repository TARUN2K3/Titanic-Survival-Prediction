# Titanic Survival Prediction

Predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning.

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features such as age, gender, and class, the goal is to build a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived or not.

## Steps

1. Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about Titanic passengers, including whether they survived or not.

2. Data Exploration

Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features, missing values, and potential relationships between variables.

3. Data Preprocessing

Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and any other issues that may affect model performance.

4. Feature Engineering

Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.

5. Model Selection

Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for predicting passenger survival.

6. Model Training

Train the selected model on the training dataset, utilizing techniques such as cross-validation.

7. Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

8. Hyperparameter Tuning

Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its predictive ability.

9. Deployment

Deploy the trained model for making predictions on new, unseen data.

## Demo

Provide a demo or examples of how to use the trained model for predicting survival.
